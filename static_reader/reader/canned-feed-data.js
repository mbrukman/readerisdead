Since we still have a few weeks of spring <a href=\"http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/info/seasons.html\">left</a>, the Reader team is taking this opportunity to clean things up a bit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Simplifying comments</b></p>\n\n<p>Ever since we <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/03/google-reader-is-your-new-watercooler.html\">launched</a> support for comments on shared items, one of the most frequent points of confusion has been \"who can comment on my shared items?\" (or rather, \"why can't I comment on my friends' shared items?\"). Up until now, someone had to be in a designated sharing group to be able to comment on a post, even if you were sharing publicly. To make things a lot simpler, we've made it so that if you can see a shared item, you can comment on it.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who are sharing publicly, the next time you log in to Reader you'll get a choice between continuing to share publicly and allowing anyone to comment on your shared items, or switching to protected sharing:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/S_qlWajx-MI/AAAAAAAAH_E/ZwOgnjpbT8o/s640/comments.png\" width=\"462\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Comments dialog\">\n</p>\n\n<p>Nothing will change for users who already had their shared items protected, since visibility and commenting for their shared items was already consistent. Keep in mind that you can always update who can view and comment on your shared items on the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#friends-manager-page\">sharing settings</a> page.</p>\n\n<p><b>Phasing out support for older browsers</b></p>\n\n<p>Reader is joining <a href=\"http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2010/01/web-browser-support-for-docs-and-sites.html\">Docs</a> (and many other sites) in removing support for older browsers, notably Internet Explorer 6, Firefox 1.0 and 2.0, Safari 2.0 and 3.0, and Chrome 1.0, 2.0. and 3.0. Reader is a cutting edge web application, and this will allow us to spend our time improving Reader instead of fixing issues with antiquated browsers. Starting on June 1, users of older browsers will begin to see a notification encouraging them to upgrade to any of Reader\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?answer=182666\">supported browsers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Discontinuing offline access via Gears</b></p>\n\n<p>We launched <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html\">offline support</a> three years ago, but only a minority of Reader users actively use it today. Because supporting offline access requires a large ongoing engineering effort, and because Gears itself is being <a href=\"http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html\">surpassed by HTML5</a>, we've decided to remove offline support in Reader starting on June 1.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we know that offline access is important to some of you, and with the wide range of third party clients that sync with Google Reader, you don\u2019t need to give it up. Depending on your operating system, we recommend taking a look at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/\">NetNewsWire</a> (Mac OS X)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx\">FeedDemon</a> (Windows)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://liferea.sourceforge.net/\">Liferea</a> (Linux)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of these alternatives will sync your subscriptions and read state with Reader, and continue to provide offline access to your feeds. For more information, please see our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?answer=182658\">help center</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We realize that removing features and support <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2008/07/22/more_about_deleting_features\">is</a> <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/595644480\">not</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/10/subtractive_sof.html\">easy</a>, but with this spring cleaning done, we've laid the groundwork for more Reader improvements down the line.

Here's a round-up of the changes we've made over the past month:</p>\n\n<p>We've added support for the HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tags, so that when you come across <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/4366695\">an awesome video</a> you can <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/item/tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3fdf429d35e50dff\">share it</a> in such a way that your mobile device-using friends can see it too.</p>\n\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/S-Q5r6iZRSI/AAAAAAAAHxs/pXlyFr_nLd0/s1600/not-interested.png\" width=\"199\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Not interested command\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px\">\nWe realize that our <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/02/may-we-recommend.html\">recommended items</a> may not always hit the spot (though who wouldn't like <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/lovelylisting/~3/K803QDR_jzc/\">a water slide in their house</a>). There is now a \"Not interested\" link at the bottom of recommended items, so that you can both hide that item and provide signals to our algorithms about the kinds of things you like and dislike.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/S-RGYFMJNLI/AAAAAAAAHxw/XekGDE3hTGw/s640/update.png\" width=\"342\" height=\"21\" alt=\"New version banner\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px\">Reader is the kind of application that people keep open in a tab all day. While it's flattering that our users are so dedicated, we want to make sure that they don't miss out on any new features and bug fixes that we release. We've therefore added a small banner that appears whenever we release a new version. If you're in the middle of something, you can ignore it (and it'll go away for a while), but if not, newest and shinier things are just a click away. Incidentally, today we built the 500th version of Reader; over the 5 years that we've worked on Reader, that works out to almost two builds a week.</p>\n\n<p>A few improvements to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/play\">Reader Play</a>: When you hit space (or shift-space), you're now automatically moved between posts, and for posts with multiple images, cycled through each image. We've also added made Play more configurable by letting you change the URL used:\n<ul>\n<li>If you add a <code>welcome=0</code> query parameter, the welcome screen is skipped, even for new and signed-out users.</li>\n<li>An <code>autoplay=1</code> query parameter can be used to start moving through posts automatically.</li>\n<li>A <code>#feed/<i>&lt;URL&gt;</i></code> fragment allows you to display a specific feed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can combine all these to make <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/play/?welcome=0&amp;autoplay=1#feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/seekingfocus\">automatically playing slideshows</a> of your favorite photoblogs.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we've done a few other small things, like the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#overview-page\">Home</a> view loading faster, and the <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/08/flurry-of-features-for-feed-readers.html\">Send to</a> functionality being less susceptible to being stymied by popup blockers when used with services such as Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>The way we prioritized these tweaks and fixes was based on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader\">forum</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/googlereader\">Twitter</a> feedback, so please keep it coming.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=DUB9FbT7fdA:cgFtz6ol9Eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=DUB9FbT7fdA:cgFtz6ol9Eg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=DUB9FbT7fdA:cgFtz6ol9Eg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=DUB9FbT7fdA:cgFtz6ol9Eg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/DUB9FbT7fdA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1273260883160", "published": 1273260840, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1321320983, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/01320433584539212870/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Arif Siddiquee's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Brian Shih", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fbc6b6988848fd77", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read", "user/01320433584539212870/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/tracking-kept-unread"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/04/veritable-boatload-of-read-items.html"}], "title": "A veritable boatload of read items", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/2AhKUObVxQw/veritable-boatload-of-read-items.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1270840561812398", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "Posted by Brian Shih, Product Manager\n\n<p>Wow.

And if you\u2019re aiming to join the (recently founded) One Million Club, we\u2019re talking over 26 years. So, uh, time to start reading?</p>\n\n<p>While we were at it, we took a look at what users are starring, sharing, and liking the most. While many of the most-starred items are reference posts, collections of tips, or tutorials from our friends over at <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/\">Lifehacker</a>, the most starred item lately is actually <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/scanners/2010/03/generic_movie.html\">this hilarious video</a>. That same video also shows up near the top of the latest and most liked or shared items, along with a collection of <a href=\"http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2010/03/11/horsetail-firefall/\">interesting images</a>, <a href=\"http://designyoutrust.com/2010/03/08/tree-railing/\">designs</a>, and <a href=\"http://ffffound.com/image/3b66e92ebfe6bf8ec98611545ee34ff7986fefa5\">bizarrely useless machines</a>. It\u2019s clear that the crowd is onto something here, so if you\u2019re not getting these items in your current feeds, maybe it\u2019s time to check out <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/play/\">Reader Play</a> or the Recommended items section in Reader.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. We\u2019re shipping the badges soon.

We knew that free shirts would be a hit, but we learned something much more important: a lot of people have read a lot of items. (At an average of thirty seconds per item, the most prolific readers had spent more than 180 full days of their lives perusing stuff on Reader \u2014 what Blogger <a href=\"http://buzz.blogger.com/2010/03/saving-one-million-hours-per-week.html\">gives</a>, Reader takes away)</p>\n\n<p>After the conference, several of us felt like shirts didn't seem like enough of a reward for all the valuable hours people have spent trolling through so many feeds. One thing led to another, we did a few calculations, drank a few too many cups of coffee, and today we're happy to announce Google Reader's first rewards program: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googlereader/reader-advantage.html\">ReaderAdvantage\u2122</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The ReaderAdvantage\u2122 program is simple. You get one point for each item you read. The more you read, the more you get. Then you can trade in your points for cool stuff. And because we believe in a little friendly competition, there are four levels of ReaderAdvantage\u2122 status:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Novice: 999 points</li>\n<li>Gold: 25,000 points</li>\n<li>Platinum: 133,700 points</li>\n<li>Totally Sweet: 314,159 points</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We considered inventing a secret ReaderAdvantage\u2122 handshake, but instead we created embroidered badges to ensure that members can easily identify their compatriots.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IzPv6nN_aWE/S7S0oj5ekvI/AAAAAAAAADE/G8VWiN44Wl4/s1600/reader-advantage-badge.jpg\"><img width=\"274\" height=\"183\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IzPv6nN_aWE/S7S0oj5ekvI/AAAAAAAAADE/G8VWiN44Wl4/s320/reader-advantage-badge.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Get your badge on\" title=\"Get your badge on!\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you use Google Reader, there's no reason not to join.

And while some of them try Reader and find it really useful, many of them aren\u2019t interested in taking the time to get Reader set up. That\u2019s why today, I\u2019m happy to announce an experimental product from the Google Reader team that makes the best stuff in Reader more accessible for everyone, while giving Reader users a new way to view their feeds. It\u2019s called Google Reader Play, and it\u2019s a new way to browse interesting stuff on the web that\u2019s easy to use and personalized to the things you like. Best of all, there\u2019s no set-up required: visit <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/play\">google.com/reader/play</a> to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2JFEjPkI/AAAAAAAAARs/ujaRKLEKt7Y/s1600-h/play-image-2.png\"><img alt=\"Google Reader Play screenshot\" border=\"0\" height=\"279\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2JFEjPkI/AAAAAAAAARs/ujaRKLEKt7Y/s400/play-image-2.png\" width=\"400\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In Google Reader Play, items are presented one at a time, and each item is big and full-screen. After you've read an item, just click the next arrow to move to the next one, or click any item on the filmstrip below to fast-forward. Of course, you can click the title or image of any item to go to the original version. And since so much of the good stuff online is visual, we automatically enlarge images and auto-play videos full-screen.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2QdvS1dI/AAAAAAAAAR0/geNdKp5AUzo/s1600-h/play-video.png\"><img alt=\"Google Reader Play video screenshot\" border=\"0\" height=\"278\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2QdvS1dI/AAAAAAAAAR0/geNdKp5AUzo/s400/play-video.png\" width=\"400\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Reader Play adapts to your tastes -- as you browse, you can let us know which stuff you enjoy by clicking the \"like\" button, and we'll use that info to show you more items we think you'll like. If you want, you can also choose categories, and we'll personalize your stream to only show you stuff from those categories. And you don't even need a Google account to use Reader Play. Of course, if you want to star, like, or share items, we'll ask you to sign in to your Google account. Since Reader and Reader Play share the same infrastructure, any actions you take in one will be reflected in the other.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2ZZJUnaI/AAAAAAAAAR8/38gE7NMejuo/s1600-h/stars-etc.png\"><img alt=\"Google Reader Play actions\" border=\"0\" height=\"129\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S5f2ZZJUnaI/AAAAAAAAAR8/38gE7NMejuo/s400/stars-etc.png\" width=\"300\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering where we find all the awesome stuff in Reader Play. It uses the same technology as the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=164681\">Recommended Items</a> feed in Reader to identify and aggregate the most interesting items on the web. If you sign in, Reader Play will also be personalized with items that people you\u2019re following have shared in Google Reader, and items similar to ones you\u2019ve previously liked, starred, or shared.</p>\n\n<p>Since Reader Play is an experiment, it\u2019s launching in <a href=\"http://labs.google.com/\">Google Labs</a> for now. To be clear, Reader Play isn't intended to replace Google Reader: both Google Reader and Reader Play are about finding and reading interesting stuff online. In essense, Reader Play is a different view of Reader. It's designed to be a fun and easy way to browse interesting items, while Reader is a highly customizable way to organize your feeds, keep track of what you've read, and much more. In Reader, you can switch to this view by clicking \"View in Reader Play\" from the feed settings menu.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/S5gJ6d-Tt7I/AAAAAAAAHH4/nIgVbukfi70/s1600-h/play-folder.png\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/S5gJ6d-Tt7I/AAAAAAAAHH4/nIgVbukfi70/s320/play-folder.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"174\" alt=\"View in Reader Play command\" style=\"border:solid 1px #ccc;padding:5px\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/play\">Try Reader Play</a> today and let us know what you think.

Today we're rolling out a change in Google Reader that lets you create a custom feed to track changes on pages that don't have their own feed. </p>\n\n<p>These custom feeds are most useful if you want to be alerted whenever a specific page has been updated. For example, if you wanted to follow Google.org's latest products, just type \"http://www.google.org/products.html\" into Reader's \"Add a subscription\" field. Click \"create a feed\", and Reader will periodically visit the page and publish any significant changes it finds as items in a custom feed created just for that page.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S137k49N3DI/AAAAAAAAAQE/OGRTVm0gkj0/s1600-h/Picture+11.png\"><img style=\"display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:73px\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/S137k49N3DI/AAAAAAAAAQE/OGRTVm0gkj0/s400/Picture+11.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n\n<p>Here are some more example feeds for sites without feeds that you could follow:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www1.macys.com/catalog/index.ognc?CategoryID=27416&amp;PageID=117753556101860&amp;kw=Special%20Offers\">Macy's - special offers</a> [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/webfeed%2F8765363390147717237\">view in Reader</a>]</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/\">NYU Computer Science homepage</a> [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/webfeed%2F12825487959154103617\">view in Reader</a>]</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://zillow.com/\">Zillow.com homepage</a>  [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/webfeed%2F7213111791824341699\">view in Reader</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We provide short snippets of page changes to help you quickly decide if the page is worth revisiting and we're working on improving the quality of these snippets.

Just as the <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/search-gets-personal.html\">launch of Personalized Search</a> improved search results based on your search history, these changes use your Reader Trends to improve your reading experience.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Explore section</b> - We're always trying to help you discover new stuff in Reader, and today we're introducing \"Popular items\" and \"Recommended sources\", two ways to find interesting content from all over the Internet. We use algorithms to find top-rising images, videos and pages from anywhere (not just your subscriptions), collect them in the new <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/pop%2Ftopic%2Ftop%2Flanguage%2Fen\">Popular items</a> section and order them by what we think you&#39;ll like best. Now you don&#39;t have to be embarrassed about missing that hilarious video everyone is talking about \u2014 it should show up in your &quot;Popular items&quot; feed automatically. And to make it easier to find interesting feeds, we&#39;re moving <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-interns-recommendations-and.html\">recommendations</a> into the new Explore section and giving it a new name \u2014 &quot;Recommended sources.&quot; Like always, it uses your <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#trends-page\">Reader Trends</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/history/\">Web History</a> (if you're opted into Web History) to generate a list of feeds we think you might like.\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/SuBpHvrIIvI/AAAAAAAAAOs/1atDtAFjMas/s1600-h/explore.png\"><img width=\"260\" height=\"168\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/SuBpHvrIIvI/AAAAAAAAAOs/1atDtAFjMas/s400/explore.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Explore section\"></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><b>Personalized ranking</b> - Only have a 10 minute coffee break and want to see the best items first? All feeds now have a new sort option called \"magic\" that re-orders items in the feed based on your personal usage, and overall activity in Reader, instead of default chronological order. Click \"Sort by magic\" under the \"Feed settings\" menu of your feed (or folder) to switch to personalized ranking. Unlike the old \"auto\" ranking, this new ranking is personalized for you, and gets better with time as we learn what you like best \u2014 the more you \"like\" and \"share\" stuff, the better your magic sort will be. Give it a try on a high-volume feed folder or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/reading-list\">All items</a> and see for yourself!\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/SuBpPXdY4xI/AAAAAAAAAO0/thg0e3fGi6s/s1600-h/ranking.png\"><img width=\"191\" height=\"134\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/SuBpPXdY4xI/AAAAAAAAAO0/thg0e3fGi6s/s400/ranking.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Magic sorting\"></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of personalization at Google remains the same as ever: to help you find the best content on the web.

{"content": "<p>Since our last <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/07/following-liking-and-people-searching.html\">big launch</a>, we've been thinking about ways to help our users better share, discover, and consume content in Reader. Today, I'm happy to announce several new features that we hope will further improve the way you use Reader.</p>\n\n<p><b>Send to...</b><br>\n\n<img alt=\"Send to menu\" height=\"94\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SoNMxnP6BHI/AAAAAAAAFJ8/7frn14aFZck/s400/send-to.png\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:5px\" width=\"220\">We've made it easier to share posts you like to Blogger, Twitter, Facebook, and more, with our new \"Send to\" feature. (Incidentally, Blogger is celebrating its <a href=\"http://buzz.blogger.com/2009/06/blogger-is-turning-10.html\">tenth birthday</a> this month, and we're hoping our friends there will like this little birthday present.)<br>\nJust head over to the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/settings?display=item-links\">settings page</a>, and enable the services you want to use. If your favorite service isn't listed (and you're feeling extra geeky), you can create your own \"Send to\" link with a URL template.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SoNMcIwFR4I/AAAAAAAAFJ0/9zbc7IZJbhE/s1600-h/settings.png\"><img alt=\"Send to tab on the settings page\" border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SoNMcIwFR4I/AAAAAAAAFJ0/9zbc7IZJbhE/s400/settings.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<p>To share an item on one of your sites, simply click the \"Send to\" button and choose your service. If you're into keyboard shortcuts, \"shift-t\" will do the same.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feeds from people you follow</b><br>\n\nWhen we added following, we tried to make it easier to find and follow people who share similar interests. Now we've gone even further, and made it possible for you to subscribe directly to the blogs, photos, or Twitter updates that anyone you're following has included on their Google profile.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img alt=\"Feeds from Mihai\" height=\"288\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SoNNJ2i3ifI/AAAAAAAAFKE/NuWsjrNq0Rg/s1600/feeds.png\" width=\"430\">\n</p>\n\n<p>To quickly subscribe to these sites, click the \"<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#directory-page/3\">From people you follow</a>\" tab on the \"Browse for stuff\" page.</p>\n\n<p><b>More control for mark all as read</b><br>\n<img alt=\"Mark all as read menu\" height=\"119\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SoNOrDxzQ5I/AAAAAAAAFKM/6aYLQKIRfO0/s400/markallasread.png\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:5px\" width=\"200\">We know people can be overwhelmed by too many unread items, and sometimes only want to see recent posts. The \"Mark all as read\" button now has a menu that lets you choose to only mark items as read if they're older than your specified time frame. A tip of the hat to <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/\">Nick Bradbury</a> who pioneered this \"<a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/feed-overload-h.html\">panic button</a>\" feature.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a few small tweaks in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you expand an item in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/user%2F-%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fbroadcast-friends-comments\">comment view</a>, you now get the full set of actions, enabling you to share, like, and star items without leaving comment view.</li>\n<li>We added a \"Feeds\" start-page <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/isettings\">option</a> for the iPhone/Android/Pre mobile interface, so you can see a list of your subscriptions when you sign in.</li>\n<li>There is now an option to show notes when <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/clip-creator/user/-/state/com.google/broadcast\">embedding</a> your shared items on other pages as clips.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As always, if you have feedback, please head over to <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-help\">our help group</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/googlereader\">Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"http://getsatisfaction.com/google/products/google_google_reader\">Get Satisfaction</a>.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-7489479312959422092?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=bbKxbmm1Pqs:-BlObWm_lS8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=bbKxbmm1Pqs:-BlObWm_lS8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=bbKxbmm1Pqs:-BlObWm_lS8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=bbKxbmm1Pqs:-BlObWm_lS8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/bbKxbmm1Pqs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1250121776442", "published": 1250121600, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1249506818, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Jeff Huber's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/03755402635155620060/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Ihar Mahaniok's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/01320433584539212870/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Arif Siddiquee's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a23e3fbbfebc78e1", "categories": ["user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/03755402635155620060/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/tracking-item-link-used", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read", "user/01320433584539212870/state/com.google/broadcast"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/08/pubsubhubbub-support-for-reader-shared.html"}], "title": "PubSubHubbub support for Reader shared items", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/WEoBew65abc/pubsubhubbub-support-for-reader-shared.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1249506968604882", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/\">Speed</a> is very important at Google, and the Reader team is no exception. One way in which we take speed into account is to try to make consumption of feeds be as efficient as possible. We also want to make it as fast (and as easy) as possible to interact with your Reader data on the rest of the web.</p>\n\n<p>We're therefore happy to announce that Reader has begun adoption of the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PubSubHubbub protocol</a>, beginning with the publishing of our shared items. All <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/mihai.parparita\">shared item pages</a> have <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F14548369432350969777%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fbroadcast\">feeds</a>, and now all of those feeds will ping <a href=\"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\">a hub</a> (and there's a <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;hub&quot; .../&gt;</code> element in them). This means that if you (as a web app developer) would like to more efficiently and quickly monitor Reader shares, you just have to subscribe at the hub to be notified of changes in real-time. If you want to learn more about PubSubHubbub and how it works, see <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">the site</a> and <a href=\"http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.1.html\">protocol definition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One place that takes advantage of this pinging is <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com\">FriendFeed</a>. This means if you have added your shared items to your FriendFeed account, you and your friends will see them there within a few seconds the \"Share\" link being pressed in Reader (special thanks to FriendFeeder <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/bgolub\">Benjamin Golub</a> for making sure the experience was as smooth as possible). You can see this in action <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/search?q=service%3Agooglereader\">in FriendFeed's search results</a> and in the screencast below:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<iframe src=\"/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7H9TWzHzFCk%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;width=560&amp;height=340\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></iframe>\n</p>\n\n<p>Adding PubSubHubbub support was a 20% project between <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles/bradfitz\">Brad Fitzpatrick</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles/bslatkin\">Brett Slatkin</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles/mihai.parparita\">myself</a>, each of us working in our spare time over the past couple of weeks. Adding PubSubHubbub to your application is definitely a low-effort but high-payoff way of making the Web faster and more efficient.

Today, we're pleased to announce that we've made four improvements to give you more sharing control and help you easily find other people's publicly shared items within Reader.</p>\n\n<b>Find and follow other people</b>\n\n<p>Instead of sharing your items with others and hoping they reciprocate, you can now find people with public shared items and subscribe to their shared items with one click. Use our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#profile-search/clinton\">new people search feature</a> (powered by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles\">Google profiles</a>) to look for people who have public shared items. You can browse by name, location, or topic, and start following new people -- all from inside Reader.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45Sy5L9XI/AAAAAAAAAN8/xbd0LQEP5F0/s1600-h/peoplesearch.png\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45Sy5L9XI/AAAAAAAAAN8/xbd0LQEP5F0/s400/peoplesearch.png\" alt=\"People search example\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n\n<b>Shhh, just between us friends...</b>\n\n<p>If sharing publicly isn't your cup of tea, we now allow you to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#friends-manager-page\">share items with a specific group or with multiple groups</a>. If you choose to do this, only people you add to your sharing groups will be able to see and comment on your shared items. If you use Gmail, you will notice that these are the same groups from your <a href=\"http://www.google.com/contacts\">Gmail contacts</a> -- so, changes you make to these groups in Reader will change them in Gmail as well.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45bT0LpZI/AAAAAAAAAOE/BLBX1J2f4uk/s1600-h/protected.png\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"108\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45bT0LpZI/AAAAAAAAAOE/BLBX1J2f4uk/s400/protected.png\" alt=\"Sharing settings\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n\n<b>Take your 15 minutes of fame</b>\n\n<p>If you want people who visit your Google profile to know what you're interested in on Reader, add a link to your shared items to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles\">your Google profile</a>.  Once you <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#friends-manager-page\">check the box</a> marked \"Add a link to my Google profile,\" anyone using the search feature within Reader will be able to find and follow your shared items.</p>\n\n<p>To make it even easier for people to find you, you can also give your Reader shared items page a custom URL that uses your Google username, like <i>www.google.com/reader/shared/pink.black</i>. You need to enable this under \"Profile URL\" on your Google profile first.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45HCa2dLI/AAAAAAAAAN0/1JuUrBBqn-c/s1600-h/public.png\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"95\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl45HCa2dLI/AAAAAAAAAN0/1JuUrBBqn-c/s400/public.png\" alt=\"Shared items on profile\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n\n<b>If you liked it, then you shoulda put a \"like\" on it</b>\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted to tell an author or publisher that you appreciate an article they wrote? Or maybe you want to let your friend know that you enjoyed the blog post he shared with you.  With a quick click of the mouse (or a swipe of the \"L\" key -- for the keyboard shortcut pros), you can \"like\" any item in Reader. All \"likes\" are public, so anyone reading an item you've \"liked\" in Reader can see that you're a fan. Checking out shared items for people who have \"liked\" the same items as you is a great way to discover other people with interests similar to your own.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl445s0TcwI/AAAAAAAAANs/ttmeKRZCjJ0/s1600-h/likes.png\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O3jT2uzrsQE/Sl445s0TcwI/AAAAAAAAANs/ttmeKRZCjJ0/s400/likes.png\" alt=\"Liking\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n\n<b>And one last comment about comments</b>\n\n<p>One small note for this release: the ability to see and add comments to shared items is still restricted only to people you have in a sharing group (i.e. \"Friends\").

We've added a new set of tabs to the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#trends-page\">trends</a> page called \"Friends trends.\" This way you can see which of your friends share the most, and whose shared items you actually get around to reading.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/ShMjYUAzNSI/AAAAAAAAEPg/-5liV5BlVC4/s1600/friend-trends.png\" width=\"344\" height=\"324\" alt=\"Friends trends\" style=\"padding:5px;border:solid 1px #ddd\">\n</p>\n\n<p>In other social-related news, we're <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/04/meeting-friends-of-friends.html\">continuing</a> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/googlereader/status/1426966342\">to</a> <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/03/google-reader-is-your-new-watercooler.html\">iterate</a> on our comments feature. With this release, comments are now available to our non-English users. Additionally, item sources are now visible in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/broadcast-friends-comments\">comment view</a> and it's easier to mark items as read there.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/ShMktvDVkUI/AAAAAAAAEPo/-vwO2A3DJWE/s400/igoogle-import.png\" width=\"364\" height=\"62\" alt=\"iGoogle import\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px;border:solid 1px #ddd;margin:0 0 5px 5px\">Another area that we've focused on improving is the new user experience; we know that a fully armed and operational Reader account can help users go through a large amount of information very quickly, but getting to that point can be daunting. We've recently released a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#welcome-page\">revamped new user page</a> that tries to help with that. In addition to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1d-b8wzzMY\">a welcome video</a> and a tutorial, it also tries to help you get started by pointing out the kinds of feeds that you can subscribe to. Our most recent addition to this is the ability to import feeds from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/ig\">iGoogle</a>. This way if you're trying out Reader and already have a heavily customized iGoogle account, your feeds are just a click away.</p>\n\n<p>We've also made improvements to our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/i\">mobile</a> interface. You can now <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/i/#stream/user%2F-%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fcreated\">post notes</a> if an interesting thought occurs to you while <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhoel/299699714/\">waiting in line</a>.

In the past, there hasn't been a way to interact with these people besides reading their comments on your friends' shared items. Not anymore!</p>\n\n<p>By hovering over the name of an unfamiliar commenter you can see their profile picture and the links they've added to their <a href=\"http://www.google.com/profiles\">Google Profile</a>. Furthermore, you can click the \"Start sharing\" link to start sharing your shared items with that person!</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"534\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/Sf95TwmASpI/AAAAAAAAECU/KHS8vWXVk58/s1600/hovercard.png\" alt=\"Start sharing sample\"></p>\n\n<p>This is a great way to add new people to your friends list. When that person next logs in, they'll see an option to view your shared items as well as the option to start sharing with you. If they reciprocate, you'll have a new friend in your Reader.</p>\n\n<p>We've also made comments more visible and more flexible from within Reader. Now, you'll be able to see comments on shared items while viewing <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/reading-list\">All items</a>. You'll also be notified when new comments are made by the small speech bubble icon in your left sidebar, even when your Friends' shared items module is collapsed. While making comments, your options for formatting have been increased. Try using asterisks or underscores to spice up your comments with bold and italic text.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"262\" height=\"25\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6OZ1P5lrdvM/Sftb_aYVajI/AAAAAAAAAHo/sMw93y8v4D0/s400/ssfriendsshareditems.jpg\" alt=\"New comments indicator\"></p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> You can stop sharing your items with someone at any time by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#friends-manager-page\">Sharing settings</a> link in your left sidebar. Also, if someone chooses to share with you, your shared items are not visible to that person unless you consent. Finally, the \"start sharing\" link in profile cards will also only appear to those users sharing with friends, and not those sharing only with chat buddies.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-4290756604228539082?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=9t7xIDfpgj0:oBdE4RVDH8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=9t7xIDfpgj0:oBdE4RVDH8I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?a=9t7xIDfpgj0:oBdE4RVDH8I:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/dtKx?i=9t7xIDfpgj0:oBdE4RVDH8I:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/9t7xIDfpgj0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1241470659622", "published": 1241470740, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1236815659, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/10475262183149613289/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Bradley Hawkes's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Jenna Bilotta", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1df346b9c9651da", "categories": ["user/10475262183149613289/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/03/google-reader-is-your-new-watercooler.html"}], "title": "Google Reader is your new watercooler", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/trK-kedRIfw/google-reader-is-your-new-watercooler.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1236810291813633", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>One of the things that we love best about Reader is the ability to easily share interesting items with your friends.

So, in order to make Reader act and feel more speedy and responsive, we've removed some visual clutter, simplified some features and given everything a bit more breathing room.

For some of you (and some of us on the Reader team), unread counts are a source of anxiety and can feel more like a to-do list than the <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/01/14/i-has-a-bucket/\">random</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh7I1BcXlqM\">awesomeness</a> of the Internet. So to help you sleep better at night, we've added the ability to turn off unread counts for each section of navigation independently. Subscriptions with unread items will still appear as bold, and you can see the number of unread items if you hold your mouse over the subscription name. To really set yourself free, try turning them off for all sections. (Ahhhhhh, now doesn't that <a href=\"http://template.rt-sb.net/Agents/ejs/feature.jpg\">feel better</a>?)</p>\n\n<h4>More feed bundles!</h4>\n\n<p>Feed bundles are small sets of feeds related to a topic that you can subscribe to all at once. Historically, these were done \"by hand\" by the Reader team, but this just wasn't working out. So we've written a program to make \"bundles\" for us \u2013 no more manual editing of bundles, and a much richer and interesting set of subscriptions for you to choose from. We've added a bunch of new topic-based bundles for easier feed discovery. Just find the \"Browse for stuff\" link in the main navigation pane and look for the \"Browse all bundles\" link on the bundles tab. Now, you can learn more than you ever wanted to about NASCAR, yoga or knitting.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/STg2eVPu_eI/AAAAAAAAA7o/-4UXzB37IRI/s1600-h/File-3.png\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"183\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/STg2eVPu_eI/AAAAAAAAA7o/-4UXzB37IRI/s400/File-3.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Bundles\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<p>Looking for something that's moved?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"Refresh\" button from the subscription list is now in the Subscriptions options menu or triggered by simply clicking on the word \"Subscriptions\"</li>\n<li>The \"Show all - updated\" controls are now in the Subscriptions options menu.</li>\n<li>The \"Add subscription\" button has moved to the top of the navigation pane.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As always, we love to get feedback in our <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-help\">discussion group</a>, and we look for it in a number of <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22google+reader%22\">other</a> <a href=\"http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=%22google%20reader%22\">sources</a> -- please keep it coming!</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-1926004812824373168?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=SZJTq70u\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=SZJTq70u\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/Pdw5qzT_S5U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1228424289005", "published": 1228419540, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1226357932, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Jeff Huber's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00332801428352449735/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Joshua Peterson's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Chrix Finne", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e2a7859d173a163", "categories": ["user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read", "user/00332801428352449735/state/com.google/broadcast"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/11/is-your-web-truly-world-wide.html"}], "title": "Is Your Web Truly World-Wide?", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/GnVQlq-TWLY/is-your-web-truly-world-wide.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1226358466201831", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p><i>The Reader team is happy to announce that another 20% project has come to fruition: automatic translation in Reader!

You might have missed out on this content in the past, but now, with automatic translation in Reader, you don't have to miss a thing!</p>\n\n<p>Next time you find an interesting feed in another language, just subscribe to it as normal in Reader.  When you view the feed in Reader, check off \"Translate into my language\" in the feed settings, and (voila!) the feed will be immediately translated for you.  Also, this setting will be saved so you can always view this feed in your own language.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks go out to the awesome engineers on the <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/\">Google Translate</a> team, who have provided the technology to make this possible.

Shortly after Reader launched, one of my friends recommended a cooking blog, <a href=\"http://chocolateandzucchini.com/\">Chocolate &amp; Zucchini</a>, and I subscribed to it.  I really liked reading about new recipes on the blog on a regular basis, and I would star the ones I particularly liked so that I could find them later.  Soon, I was subscribed to many more cooking blogs, and was starring more and more favorite recipes daily.  My starred items list became very long, and it was becoming hard to find things that I remembered I liked (this was before Reader had search).</p>\n\n<p>This is when I discovered item-level tagging.  Instead of just starring <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/02/big-crumb-coffee-cake/\" title=\"Big Crumb Coffee Cake\">each</a> <a href=\"http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001976beef_stroganoff.php\" title=\"Beef Stroganoff\">recipe</a> <a href=\"http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/06/you-dont-mess-around.html\" title=\"Almond Torte with Sugared Apricots\">I</a> <a href=\"http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2007/11/salmon_rillette.html\" title=\"Salmon Rillettes\">liked</a>, I would also add a tag (or several tags) to it.  My tags were generally divided into meal ideas (e.g. \"dessert\", \"breakfast\", \"main-course\") and ingredient specifics (e.g. \"eggs\", \"vegetables\", \"meat\", \"pasta\").  This way, if we were having people over and one of the guests was vegetarian, I would browse through my pasta and vegetables tags for ideas on <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/chopped-vegetable-watermelon-and-feta-salad/\" title=\"Vegetable, Watermelon, and Feta Salad\">what</a> <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/rat-a-too-ee-for-you-ee/\" title=\"Ratatouille\">to make</a>.  Even after Reader added search, I continued to star and tag my favorite items.  Search is very useful when you know what you are looking for, but less appropriate when you are just considering what to make for dinner and don't have anything too specific in mind.</p>\n\n<p>The last tags that I have created for my item-level tagging are \"cooked\" and \"cooked-good\".  This way I can keep track of all the recipes that I have actually tried out, and not just read about.  And any time I am feeling in the mood for <a href=\"http://annesfood.blogspot.com/2006/09/big-apple-cake-with-cardamom-sugar.html\" title=\"Big Apple Cake\">something</a> (<a href=\"http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001927chicken_with_mushroom_cream_sauce.php\" title=\"Chicken with Mushroom Sauce\">somewhat</a>) <a href=\"http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2005/11/gateau_au_yaourt_a_la_myrtille.php\" title=\"Blueberry Yogurt Cake\">familiar</a>, I can browse through my \"cooked-good\" tag.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-6331696986657677131?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=UP4dAN4M\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=UP4dAN4M\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/2zyQb3oYCGs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1225986637934", "published": 1225986060, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1225372797, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Jeff Huber's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09732175596758813309/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Susan Shepard's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/04346347518086047722/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Jenna Bilotta's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/01051400489736040771/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Chrix Finne's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mike Knapp", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08e96bbde431d7ab", "categories": ["user/00520134281900353671/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/09732175596758813309/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/04346347518086047722/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/01051400489736040771/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-do-google-reader-engineers-read.html"}], "title": "What do Google Reader engineers read?", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/f8MA0YYVMhY/what-do-google-reader-engineers-read.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1225344877427563", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>We are all passionate feed readers on the Google Reader team.

href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html\" title=\"Trends\">Trends</a> page last year, we wanted to visualize how we consumed data in Google Reader. One of the more interesting sections of the Trends page is the chart that shows items read by time. Spikes in the chart are a cool way of noticing patterns and possibly realizing that the reason we're less productive on Fridays is because of Reader. Some of us on the Reader team are obsessed with keeping our unread counts low so we wondered if we were  being driven by the posting schedule of our subscriptions. We thought the chart might be more interesting if we showed when posts were coming into Reader, so we are now graphing published statistics on the same chart. For example, in my set of subscriptions, even though I'm reading the majority of items in the evening, new posts seem to arrive in the middle of the day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N66N1um9150/SQeFfpbQd4I/AAAAAAAAAWY/veYc_8nxIkM/s1600-h/chart.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:400px;height:174px\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N66N1um9150/SQeFfpbQd4I/AAAAAAAAAWY/veYc_8nxIkM/s400/chart.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Subscriptions trends\"></a>We also wanted to expose more fine-grained data. While it's useful to know what your overall reading trends are, we thought it might be interesting to also display this data on a subscription by subscription level. If you've ever been curious about when your favorite subscriptions were publishing new posts or when you were reading them, click the \"show details\" link in the upper right corner of the viewer.

Notes occasionally need more color, more flavor, more organization. So, you can now add a tag while adding a note. This is especially useful if you use lots of tags to organize your posts, or if you have multiple public shared tags. We'd like to dedicate this to our newest teammate, Mike Knapp, who enjoys being user-facing.</p>\n\n<h4>Sort your Subscriptions</h4>\n\n<p>We've had countless hours of fun <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-interns-recommendations-and.html\">dragging n' dropping</a> our feeds to keep them organized, but that can get annoying. So, in a move to delight lexicographers everywhere, you can now choose between alphabetical ordering or drag n' drop ordering for your subscription list, via an \"Options\" menu at the bottom-left of Reader's interface. This feature is dedicated to <a href=\"http://eclectic-mayhem.com/blog/\">Ben Darnell</a>, whose name is near the start of the alphabet.</p>\n\n<div style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kC-bkrlI0iM/SNk_iDKXxrI/AAAAAAAAASg/cGHPzOM7hZA/s1600/sort.PNG\" width=\"263\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Sort your feeds alphabetically\">\n</div>\n\n<p>And, as a bonus, we've exposed the date we last crawled a feed in the \"details\" area, and made some iPhone speed improvements and bug fixes.

For example, iPhone and iPod Touch owners know how powerful having a full-featured browser is. We on the Reader team are heavy <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#safari\">mobile Safari</a> users. Sometimes we use it to kill time, other times for answering important questions that come up during brunch: What is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen_Tyrol\">Tyrol</a>'s first name? How is <a href=\"http://www.clintonstreetbaking.com/\">maple butter</a> made? How do you <a href=\"http://www.rosewaterrestaurant.com/\">sweeten rhubarb</a> for sangria? What is John Gruber <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone#fn1-2008-05-09\">saying now</a>? For questions like the last one, we of course use Reader to keep up with our subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>To make our (and your) Reader iPhone experience better, we wanted to really take advantage of the iPhone's capabilities. Today we're releasing a new <b>beta</b> version of Reader designed for the iPhone and other mobile phones with advanced browsers. You can use it by visiting <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/i/\">http://www.google.com/reader/i/</a> on your phone.</p>\n\n<p>This new version is designed to offer many of the same features as the desktop, while making it quick and easy to act on items. If you've used list view, then it should be familiar to you. Scan the titles for an item that interests you, tap and it expands in place. Starring, sharing, and keeping unread are done in place, so you never have to leave the list view or refresh the page. We think it's a very fast way to power through your reading list.</p><p>Since it's still in beta, we're not going to automatically send you to it, so bookmark the site so that you don't forget the address (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/i/\">http://www.google.com/reader/i/</a>).

Raman</a> and <a href=\"http://clcworld.net/\">Charles Chen</a>, who have helped out with <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/03/reader-and-aria-new-way-to-read.html\">accessibility in Reader</a> in the past, have not rested on their laurels and have another feature to announce:</i></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SCNHQw1Yl4I/AAAAAAAAAgg/gvjJWDOGoSo/s1600/lens.png\" width=\"280\" height=\"285\" style=\"float:right;padding:4px\" alt=\"Magnification feature screenshot\">I've long maintained that CSS is one of the most well-kept (and consequently under-exploited) accessibility secrets of the Web. Thinking back to the time that CSS1 became a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1\">W3C Recommendation</a>, those of us who cared deeply about accessibility took great care to ensure that the end-user had a lot of control with respect to how content was displayed -- yet, end-user tools that allow users to leverage this capability have been rare.</p>\n\n<p>As we were experimenting with Google Reader using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-axsjax/\">AxsJAX</a>, one of the enhancements we prototyped was the addition of a simple CSS-based lens that allows the user to selectively magnify the current article. Notice that this is subtly different from using a generic screen magnifier -- in that later case, you end up magnifying the entire screen. Google Reader can be smarter; since it knows which article you are currently reading, it can selectively magnify just that article upon request. This results in much better use of screen real-estate -- something that is an even scarcer resource when you're a low-vision user.</p>\n\n<p>After prototyping this via the AxsJAX framework, we decided that this feature made sense for exposing to all our users -- we have now integrated this functionality into the main Reader interface. So with this lens in hand (your pocket) you can continue to hit <strong>j</strong> and <strong>k</strong> to move through articles, and when you find the print too small to read you can press <strong>=</strong> or <strong>-</strong> to enlarge or shrink the font of the article you're reading. The <em>C</em> in <em>CSS</em> stands for <em>Cascading</em> -- and in this case, you the end-user get to have the final say in how you consume your content by cascading your request for a larger font on top of the presentation chosen by the content publisher.</p>\n\n<p>-Raman</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-8609909586609488965?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=xYrpmHyI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=xYrpmHyI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/15FSCWalY_s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1210272499346", "published": 1210272360, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1228897983, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/01051400489736040771/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Chrix Finne's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Jenna Bilotta", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6cb8a7b9a9043ce7", "categories": ["user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/01051400489736040771/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/share-anything-anytime-anywhere.html"}], "title": "Share anything.

Now you can finally show all of your Reader friends that awesome <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=ONmhQJy1ViA&amp;feature=related\">talking cat video</a> you found, your favorite <a href=\"http://bbq.about.com/od/fishseafoodrecipes/r/bl90206c.htm\">grilled trout recipe</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-st-baking-company-new-york\">reviews of the best brunch place</a> in your neighborhood -- all without a subscription.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few new ways you can add and share interesting things in Reader:</p>\n\n<p><div style=\"float:right;padding:0.5em\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SB-NOAVTHhI/AAAAAAAAAfk/oXVTIfTUPKM/s1600/bookmarklet.png\" width=\"124\" height=\"26\" alt=\"Note in Reader\"></div><strong>Share anything with a bookmarklet</strong> - Just drag this link from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/created\">Notes page</a> up to your browser's bookmark bar and click, click, click your way to easy, no-subscription sharing in Reader. You can share any content from any web page, even if the site doesn't have a feed. For even more control over what gets shared, select some text from the page before clicking the \"Note in Reader\" bookmarklet and your selection will appear as the item's body. There's also a space for you to add an editorial note when you need to let your friends know why you are sharing something. You can always uncheck \"Add to shared items\" if you want to add something to Reader without also adding it to your shared items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Share items with a note</strong> - If you are like me, you might want to share something in Reader, but think your friends might not \"get\" why you are sharing it. Use the \"Share with note\" button on the item toolbar to create a copy of that item with your own note attached to it. Now your friends won't have to wonder if the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096808/plotsummary\">B-movie about an evil floor lamp</a> you shared was intended to be funny, sarcastic, ironic or the <em>real</em> motivation behind your next movie night.\n\n<p>\n  <img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SB-NXwVTHiI/AAAAAAAAAfs/hZ8QuXD_XN8/s1600/share-link.png\" width=\"293\" height=\"36\" alt=\"Share with note link\">\n  <br>\n  <img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SB-NpgVTHjI/AAAAAAAAAf0/peOxQOGsZH4/s1600/annotation.png\" width=\"478\" height=\"34p\" alt=\"Note on item\">\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add a note</strong> - Do you ever get the urge to just share a thought with your friends without attaching it to any particular item? Now, you can let your friends know whatever pops into your head (for better or for worse) by typing anything into the text box at the top of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/created\">Notes page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SB-ODAVTHkI/AAAAAAAAAf8/wwOBuF7pr4E/s1600/note-box.png\" width=\"387\" height=\"97\" alt=\"Notes box\">\n</p>\n\n<p>We have also added a few other small features to make your sharing even more awesome! Add a little personality to your public shared items page by choosing from three new styles from your <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/state/com.google/broadcast\">shared items page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/SB-OdQVTHlI/AAAAAAAAAgE/MXuCXrbqnus/s1600/styles.png\" width=\"330\" height=\"163\" alt=\"Shared items styles\">\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Finally, we've changed the list view to highlight when an item is being shared by a friend, as opposed to through your normal subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you like these new sharing features as much as I do, because I'm always on the lookout for even more ways to share cool things with my friends! As always, much of our feature development is in response to feedback that we get in our <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-help\">discussion group</a>, and a number of <a href=\"http://summize.com/search?q=%22google+reader%22\">other</a> <a href=\"http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=%22google%20reader%22\">sources</a> -- so please <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-howdoi/browse_thread/thread/983a2bc724147f4f\">keep it coming</a>!</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-6735667200620556517?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=aUScUn5A\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=aUScUn5A\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/WPOgB9jeQw0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1210032473703", "published": 1210031940, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1205889641, "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Chrix Finne", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/158d8741c5e9b3fc", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/skimmed", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/03/reader-and-aria-new-way-to-read.html"}], "title": "Reader and ARIA: A new way to read", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/NPDIrmSJw9Y/reader-and-aria-new-way-to-read.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1205342020958334", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>We on the Reader team are delighted to have a guest post today from Google usability expert <a href=\"http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman\">T.V. Raman</a>, who has <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/aria-for-google-reader-in-praise-of.html\">announced on the Google Blog</a> that Reader now supports ARIA-powered screenreading. Our thanks go out to T.V. and to <a href=\"http://clcworld.net/\">Charles Chen</a>, fellow Googler and creator of FireVox, for their work in enabling more people than ever to benefit from Reader. Here's T.V.'s post on how to get started:</p>\n\n <h4>ARIA For Google Reader: In Praise Of Timely Information Access!</h4>\n\n<p>\n    Here are instructions on how to set up fluent spoken feedback from screenreaders and self-voicing browsers when using Google Reader. </p>\n\n<p>\n    Spoken output support in Google Reader is implemented using <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Accessible Rich Internet Applications</span> (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-aria-20080204/\">WAI-ARIA</a>), an evolving standard for enhancing the accessibility of Web-2.0 applications. WAI-ARIA is supported at present by Firefox --- with future support forthcoming in other browsers. ARIA support in Google Reader has been tested in the following environments:\n</p><ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.clcworld.net/\">Fire Vox</a> The self-voicing extension to Firefox\n       <li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html\">Firefox 3</a> with JFW 8.0 and Window-Eyes 5.5\n        <li><a href=\"http://downloads.sourceforge.net/portableapps/Firefox_Portable_3.0_Beta_3_Rev_2_en-us.paf.exe?download\">Portable Firefox 3</a> with both JFW 8.0 and Window-Eyes 5.5\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>    Note that Firefox 3 is still in Beta and that ARIA support like the underlying standard is still in development. ARIA support in Google Reader is designed to help end-users experience the benefits of a powerful Web-2.0 application, while giving browser implementors and adaptive technology vendors a real-world application on which to test their implementations.</p>\n\n<h4>Activating ARIA Support In Google Reader</h4>\n\n<p>    When you first open <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader\">Google Reader</a> using a screenreader, you will hear an <span style=\"font-style:italic\">invisible link</span> labeled <u>click here for ARIA enhanced Google Reader</u>. Follow this link to activate ARIA support. You can <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/axs\">bookmark the resulting page</a> for future use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Once on the ARIA-enabled Google Reader, press ? to hear a list of available keyboard commands. Power users note: most of these keyboard commands are available in the default version of Google Reader.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Please send all feedback to Google Group <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/accessible/\">Accessible</a>.</p>\n<p>\n  -Raman</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-6622727427365269925?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=a3amBWQW\"><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=a3amBWQW\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/NPDIrmSJw9Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1205342020958", "published": 1205340240, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1228897984, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/05763917848110205585/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Louis Gray's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/07612027119295739225/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Chris Wetherell's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/01553399575080976215/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Laurence Gonsalves's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c74e1b4fffeea57", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/tracking-item-link-used", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/05763917848110205585/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/07612027119295739225/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read", "user/01553399575080976215/state/com.google/broadcast"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/03/one-more-step.html"}], "title": "One more step", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/BzLHPNIRegQ/one-more-step.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1204783955461696", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p><div style=\"float:right;text-align:center;font-size:smaller;padding:0 0 5px 5px\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/R89-XehmElI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/Upnmvru-ayw/s1600/climb.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"405\"><br>photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/groundzero/143680966/\">groundzero</a> (<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en\">CC-licensed</a>)</div>Not every Reader release is filled with <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/12/reader-and-talk-are-friends.html\">exciting</a> <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-interns-recommendations-and.html\">new</a> <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-20ers.html\">features</a>, but we'd like to think that every little improvement counts. While we've been working on some longer-term things, we've also had time to make some smaller changes to Reader, which we're releasing today:</p>\n\n<p><b>More languages and countries:</b> Reader is now available in <a href=\"http://www.google.at/reader\">Austria</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.cz\">Czech Republic</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.dk\">Denmark</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.fi\">Finland</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.no\">Norway</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.pl\">Poland</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.com.br\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.ru\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://reader.google.se\">Sweden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.ch/reader\">Switzerland</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com.tr/reader\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Subscriber counts:</b> If you were curious how many other subscribers a feed that you read has, you can now easily check:  use the \"show details\" link in the top-right corner. Additionally, to see how indie/hip you are, you can use the \"Most obscure\" tab on the trends page to see the feeds that you subscribe to with the least number of subscribers. Just keep in mind <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/10/subscriber-stats-summed-up.html\">what these numbers indicate</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Increased reading area:</b> By shuffling some things around in the header area, we've managed to squeeze an additional 17 pixels of reading space for feed content. This may not seem like much, but every little bit matters when consuming hundreds of posts a day.</p>\n\n<p><b>Bug fixes and performance improvements:</b> We've made Reader faster to load when you have more than a thousand subscriptions. The settings page should feel perkier too. Finally, we've squashed some bugs -- most notably, bugs that prevented profiles from loading in certain cases. We also added improved keyboard navigation and fixed a problem refreshing search results. A lot of these tweaks and bug fixes are in response to user feedback that we get in our <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-help\">discussion group</a>, so please keep it coming.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-3235461157398981088?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=Rb0GAqGj\"><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=Rb0GAqGj\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/BzLHPNIRegQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1204783955461", "published": 1204781220, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1228897984, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00503191542161621111/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Ojan Vafai's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd6cced7831409cc", "categories": ["user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/00503191542161621111/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/02/j-walking-with-reader.html"}], "title": "J-walking with Reader", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/urz8JLEzS-g/j-walking-with-reader.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1202398004444093", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p><div style=\"float:right;text-align:center;padding:0 0 0.5em 0.5em\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/R6oVJ-QtfLI/AAAAAAAAARg/l2MNGlOuRZk/s1600/keyboard.jpg\" height=\"308\" width=\"308\"><br>\nGoogle Reader Keyboard (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paolovalde/407765578/\">inspiration</a>)</div>Google Reader is well-known for its keyboard shortcuts. When going through thousands of blog posts, news items, photos, etc. a day, it's important to do this as efficiently as possible. Many users find that using the keyboard is one way of accomplishing that goal.</p>\n\n<p>The \"j\" key (which takes you to the next item) is perhaps the most well-known keyboard shortcut. However, there are many more keys to press, and I was curious to see just how much they were tapped in Google Reader. A quick analysis later, I came up with a simple top-10 list, and I thought it would be fun to share. The units here are \"milli-Js\", where 1,000 milli-Js are equivalent to all the presses \"j\" received.</p>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"clear:both;margin:1em auto\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background:#e1ecff\"><th style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px #c3d9ff;text-align:left\">Key</th><th style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px #c3d9ff;text-align:left\">Description</th><th style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px #c3d9ff;text-align:left\">Presses</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background:#f4f8ff\"><td>j</td><td>next item</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">1,000.00 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#e8eef7\"><td>n</td><td>item scan down</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">324.18 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#f4f8ff\"><td>k</td><td>previous item</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">139.49 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#e8eef7\"><td>m</td><td>mark as read/unread</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">43.91 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#f4f8ff\"><td>t</td><td>tag item</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">37.48 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#e8eef7\"><td>p</td><td>item scan up</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">31.30 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#f4f8ff\"><td>shift-n</td><td>next subscription</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">23.09 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#e8eef7\"><td>v</td><td>view original</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">17.98 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#f4f8ff\"><td>o</td><td>expand/collapse item</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">16.81 milli-Js</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#e8eef7\"><td>s</td><td>star item</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">15.45 milli-Js</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Of course, Reader has more than the 10 shortcuts listed above -- you can see them all in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?answer=69973\">this list</a>. Additionally, in some ways, the most important shortcut is not \"j\", but \"?\" (that is, shift-/). It shows you a cheat-sheet of all the other shortcuts.</p>\n\n<p>Partly based on the data we gathered, and in our quest to make Reader as keyboard-accessible as possible, we've actually added a few more with the latest release. You can use \"a\" to open up the \"Add subscription\" form, \"g\" then \"d\" to go to the \"Discover\" page, and \"g\" then \"f\" to go your friends' shared items. If you have any other keyboard shortcuts you would like, feel free to mention them in our <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-feedback/topics\">forums</a>.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17412960-3521931594383026911?l=googlereader.blogspot.com\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=EMSUwdN3\"><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=EMSUwdN3\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/urz8JLEzS-g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1202398004444", "published": 1202394300, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1228897984, "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae4d56145f8795c8", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/01/theres-feed-for-that.html"}], "title": "There&#39;s a feed for that?!", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/LeV4XLL8SVI/theres-feed-for-that.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1200355294534024", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>As an engineer on Google Reader, it's always great to hear from users, especially when it's about how Reader has helped out. I was very happy when the team received this email from Gary Patino:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I was having a hard time finding the right job here in Houston. Days would go by without talking to a single recruiter. But then I started using Google Reader to subscribe to custom-made job search feeds for craigslist, and for oodle.com (which already aggregates feeds from thousands of other classified ad websites).</p>\n\n<p>Soon I found myself flying all over the country interviewing for jobs. The employers always pay for the flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. My job hunt became like an exciting vacation! I've been to New York twice, Milwaukee, Austin, Los Angeles, and Miami. I just accepted an offer in Manhattan with a very competitive salary offer. Google Reader saved me a huge amount of time and effort with the job hunt. Thanks guys!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Gary's experience is a great reminder about the power of feeds. Feeds exist for all sort of information beyond blog and news sites and are a great way to receive timely updates. Here are some more examples of these atypical feed uses:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/R4vm2BtCsBI/AAAAAAAAAOA/wcHkggtdeQU/s1600/feed-icon.gif\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" align=\"right\" style=\"border:0\"><b>Finance:</b> Both <a href=\"http://finance.google.com/\">Google Finance</a> and <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Finance</a> let you get finance news updates for specific companies and stocks, just look for orange &quot;Subscribe&quot; or &quot;RSS&quot; icons\u00a0in your browser. To receive stock quotes (only for some stocks), you can use <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/BuildRSSUrl.aspx\">NASDAQ's</a> feeds.</p>\n\n<p><b>Weather:</b> You can get weather updates from <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/weather/rss/subscription\">The Weather Channel</a>, <a href=\"http://rss.weatherbug.com/\">WeatherBug</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.weather.gov/alerts/\">NOAA's National Weather Service</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Classifieds:</b> As Gary mentioned, both <a href=\"http://www.craigslist.org/\">craigslist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oodle.com/\">Oodle.com</a> offer feeds for all of their listings. Just look for the orange \"RSS\" link at the bottom of any results page -- <font style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255)\" color=\"#000000\">when you subscribe to a search, for, say, <a href=\"http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/aap/mnh?query=&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=1500&amp;bedrooms=&amp;neighborhood=&amp;format=rss\">apartments under $1500 in Manhattan</a>, you'll get updates when there are new apartments matching that search</font><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255)\">.\u00a0</span>Similarly, in <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">eBay</a> you can find an RSS link at the bottom of any search page, and in <a href=\"http://base.google.com/\">Google Base</a> near the top-right corner.</p>\n\n<p><b>Package tracking:</b> If you'd like to track packages that have been sent by UPS, FedEx, USPS or DHL/Airborne, you can use <a href=\"http://isnoop.net/tracking/\">isnoop.net's universal package tracking</a> or <a href=\"http://www.simpletracking.com/\">simpletracking.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Social networking:</b> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> offers feeds for many of its features; you can see notifications, status updates, and your friends' posted items in Reader, as explained on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=23\">this page</a>. For those of you that are <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\">Twitter</a> fans, you can <a href=\"http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=24\">get RSS feeds</a> for many of its pages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shopping:</b> Amazon lets you get feeds for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200202840&amp;qid=1200337180&amp;sr=1-1\">the latest popular products</a> as well as wish lists (look for the orange feed icon). Many other shopping web sites offer feeds, including <a href=\"http://shopping.yahoo.com/rss/\">Yahoo!

Once you've logged into Reader and been notified of the change, these friends will be able to see your shared items in the Reader left-hand navigation area under \"Friends' shared items\". We've provided an option to clear your shared items in case you don't want your friends to see what you've shared in the past. We've also added a Settings page so you can choose which friends you see and invite friends who aren't yet sharing to try it out.<br><br>\n\n\n\nWe're really excited about adding friends, but want to make clear that this is a work in progress.

This means that once you get into the flow of it, you can subscribe and keep track of many more sites than before. The problem then becomes: what should you subscribe to? For example, there are millions of blogs, and while <a href=\"http://beta.bloglines.com/topfeeds\">a</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/\">few</a> are well known, there are many more interesting (micro) niche blogs that would be great to subscribe to, if only you could find them.</p>\n\n<p>To help with the discovery of interesting sites to subscribe to, we just released personalized recommendations in Reader. When you visit our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/?page=directory\">discovery</a> page, you'll see quite a few feeds that we think you may find interesting. \"Interesting\" here is determined by what other feeds you subscribe to, as well as your <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=10470\">Web History</a> data, all taken into account in an automated, anonymized fashion. (To learn more about how our recommendations work, see <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=80468\">our help article</a> about them). Hopefully you'll find your recommendations interesting and helpful in getting your <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3D81E3AF935A35754C0A9659C8B63\">information-triggered dopamine squirt</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/R09MZzZUwXI/AAAAAAAAAI4/f7jbEiHSYVg/s1600/drag-drop.gif\" style=\"border:0pt none;padding:0pt 0pt 3px 5px\" align=\"right\">Recommendations make it even easier to subscribe to lots of feeds, so then the question becomes: how do you organize those feeds better? As luck would have it, one of the other features we're announcing today is drag-and-drop support for your subscriptions and folders. You can now easily move feeds between folders, as well as reorder things up and down within the list.</p>\n\n<p>On the right, you can see <a href=\"http://blog.persistent.info/\">Mihai</a>'s subscription list as he uses drag-and-drop to reorganize his <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mishmosh/360154167/\">froworkers</a> folder. (Though you may not want to let your friends know how you're ranking then, lest <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=seinfeld%20speed%20dial\">it become a competition</a>.) Of course, we can't take too much credit for drag-and-drop subscription management -- desktop aggregators have had it for a while, as have online feed readers like <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/\">NewsGator</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What these two features have in common is that (ex-)interns played a significant role in delivering both of them. Nitin Shantharam (UC Irvine) helped create the user interface for recommendations, while Olga Stroilova (MIT) had a hand in the algorithms that generate them. Meanwhile, drag-and-drop was the brainchild of Brad Hawkes (UMass Amherst), who was our intern the summer of 2006, and returned to join the Reader team full-time earlier this year. As RIE (Reader Intern Emeritus), Brad paved the way for the great student help that we've had this year. Also to be mentioned is <a href=\"http://www.imjasonh.com/\">Jason Hall</a> (Kent State), who was behind many interface improvements that have been live for a few months already. All told, our interns (and ex-interns) have done great work this year!\n</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=36uvuzxw\"><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=36uvuzxw\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/PJ4AJRtF2Zo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1196393726366", "published": 1196390340, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1228897985, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/05429296530037195610/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Neil Sanchala's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Chris Wetherell", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88cb1048fc80e02e", "categories": ["user/05429296530037195610/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/what-do-reader-and-heroes-have-in.html"}], "title": "What do Reader and Heroes have in common?", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/1H8RvXzWezk/what-do-reader-and-heroes-have-in.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1195528406957408", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<br><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Li7qBhI/AAAAAAAAAF0/yB-pPQLuLgk/s1600-h/chair.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Li7qBhI/AAAAAAAAAF0/yB-pPQLuLgk/s400/chair.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n<br>\nWorking at Google can be a pretty demanding job. But, as any member of the Google Reader team can attest, at least we're not subject to dangling from a harness that's strapped to one of our co-workers while lasers plot the path of massive cranes to swoop around us at high speeds while we're trying to do our job.<br>\n<br>\nA few months ago, thanks to the graciousness of a group of artists, we saw that in person.<br>\n<br>\nGoogle Reader is created and maintained by a small team of folks who all have a lot on their plates. Occasionally, we need a vacation. But planning a shared experience that's fun for everyone is tricky. Common points among people can be difficult to find -- unless you get lucky and work with a bunch of dorks who like superhero stories.<br>\n<br>\n\nIt turns out that nearly all of us got sucked into <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/\" title=\"Heroes\">Heroes</a> sometime during its first season, and a <a href=\"http://www.bizstone.com/\" title=\"good friend of mine\">good friend of mine</a> knows a director who was going to get to shoot an episode. So we asked if we could visit the set for our team's annual offsite. Despite this seeming like a longshot, a trip was arranged and we headed to the Heroes lot for a day of set gawking.<br>\n<br>\nBe forewarned: nerd-level, in-depth pop-culture details to follow.<br>\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Ly7qBiI/AAAAAAAAAF8/lyWfUOFz4dU/s1600-h/greg.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Ly7qBiI/AAAAAAAAAF8/lyWfUOFz4dU/s400/greg.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n\n<br>\nOur trip was amazing, and we owe a huge thanks to the director, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944981/\" title=\"Greg Yaitanes\">Greg Yaitanes</a>, and his crew, particularly <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/calvinswagon\" title=\"Ben Grayson\">Ben Grayson</a> (whose attention and help made it a memorable day). Greg is a bit of a TV wunderkind -- he's directed many, many shows, including: Lost, Alias, Grey's Anatomy, House M.D., Prison Break, Nip/Tuck, CSI:NY, CSI:Miami, Women's Murder Club, Bones, Commander In Chief, Children of Dune, Las Vegas, V.I.P, and many more. Looking at his resume makes my eyes water, since he's only a few days older than me and he's done so much that it makes me wonder if I'm using my Saturdays really as effectively as I could.<br>\n<br>\nWatching Greg work was enlightening. He let us sit behind him as he directed a few scenes of tonight's \"<i>Cautionary Tales</i>\" episode. This one was written by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2184587/\" title=\"Joe Pokaski\">Joe Pokaski</a>, who's been behind some of our more favorite recent moments such as Claire's toe-cutting experiment. The first scene we watched being filmed was an in-car scene featuring Sendhil Ramamurthy (Mohinder) and Jack Coleman (Mr. Bennet, \"H.R.G\") both of whom we got to meet. We can't post spoilers, of course. But they both turned out to be zombie vampire aliens! (Kidding. Or are we...?)<br> \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Ly7qBjI/AAAAAAAAAGE/bnyKfekBGPk/s1600-h/ocular.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7Ly7qBjI/AAAAAAAAAGE/bnyKfekBGPk/s400/ocular.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7LS7qBgI/AAAAAAAAAFs/pIoLP51sSJk/s1600-h/boom.jpg\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_q8Da8bf-x2I/R0H7LS7qBgI/AAAAAAAAAFs/pIoLP51sSJk/s400/boom.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n\n<br>\nThere were surprises for us on set. First, we were treated to personal time with the creative staff, who graciously explained their work and even took us on tours. We walked within and around many of the common sets used on Heroes, including <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/isaacsloft/\" title=\"Isaac&#39;s loft\">Isaac's loft</a>, the Suresh apartment, the Company, the Dawsons' beautiful and meticulously created New Orleans home, the police department were Matt works -- and we all jockeyed for picture time in front of the ocular on <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Image:Rooftop_future.jpg\" title=\"the Deveaux rooftop\">the Deveaux rooftop</a>.<br>\n<br>\nMid-day, we were surprised by a visit by <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/credits/credits_tim.shtml\" title=\"Tim Kring\">Tim Kring</a>, who created Heroes and was kind enough to walk us through the editing rooms and even let us sit in on a \"spotting\" meeting. Spotting, in this case, meant visually evaluating the progress of special effects of a battle scene involving 17th-century Japanese warriors. We also saw early editions of Kristin Bell (Elle) ruthlessly wielding her power.<br>\n<br>\nTim was forthcoming, honest, direct and a delight to talk shop with. We ended our day by staying out of Ray Liotta's way (he was on the lot for something unrelated to Heroes) and guessing how the season would end. (Asking us would be futile, we don't know -- really!)<br>\n<br>\nNo one needed to be that nice to a group of wandering dorks.

It's also a nice way to give a shout out to the authors of the blogs that I like. However, maintaining a blogroll can be a bit of a pain as your subscriptions ebb and flow.</p>\n\n<p>As a heavy user of Google Reader, I figured that the best way to get a blogroll would be to have Reader generate it for me, based on my subscriptions. This didn't seem to hard, so I chatted to the Reader team and then set about implementing a this feature in my 20% time.</p>\n\n<p>Well, now it's ready for prime time! Head over to the \"Tags\" section on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/settings\">the settings page</a>, make one of the tags you use for subscriptions public, and click on &quot;add a blogroll to your site.&quot; For an example, head over to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.steve-lacey.com/\">my personal blog</a>, and you can see my blogroll in action over on the right.</p>\n\n<p>20% time is such a wonderful thing. As well as being able to actually implement my own wishlist in another Google product, I get to play around with technologies that I might not use day-to-day. As a backend engineer, mucking around in frontend code can be refreshing...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/RzDuIJjDRpI/AAAAAAAAAHc/fin37WafC9U/s1600/iphone-screenshot.gif\" alt=\"iPhone screenshot\" width=\"205\" height=\"376\" align=\"right\" style=\"border:0\">\n<b>Dolapo Falola:</b> One of my favorite Google Reader features is the ability to read feeds on my mobile phone. I'm a New Yorker so I'm out and about quite a bit without a computer. Whether it's sitting on a bus or waiting for a table for <a href=\"http://www.clintonstreetbaking.com/\">brunch</a>, Reader provides a way for me to stay informed on news, or to just kill time whenever I can get a cellular or WiFi signal.</p>\n\n<p>As Steve mentioned, 20% time lets Googlers who aren't necessarily working on Reader contribute features. I've been taking advantage of this opportunity to add small (pun intended) features to Google Reader Mobile. Some of the more interesting features I've added are the ability to see trends data on which feeds are <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/?page=trends\">viewed on mobile</a>, as well as the ability to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/m/settings\">change</a> the number of items displayed at once, or disable reformatting linked web sites for mobile phones. The latter in particular is especially useful for iPhone and other smart phones that are capable of properly displaying sites.</p>\n\n<p>This release also includes some additional changes for iPhone users. While the functionality is the same as previous versions, we've changed the user interface to make it easier to navigate and select often-used links. We've also moved the navigational buttons to the top, since it's easy to return to the top of the page by just tapping on the status bar. Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>It's also probably worth mentioning that as of last week, I'm no longer a 20%'er but a full-fledged 80%'er on the Reader team \u2014 working in my 20% time provided me with the perfect way to test the waters and eventually switch projects.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=oi66w0jN\"><img src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=oi66w0jN\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/UWwbpJdYa6g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1194402460335", "published": 1194398520, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1192461443, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/07612027119295739225/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Chris Wetherell's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39458ecd588c1edd", "categories": ["user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/07612027119295739225/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/10/subscriber-stats-summed-up.html"}], "title": "Subscriber Stats, Summed Up", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/o4allNNuKgA/subscriber-stats-summed-up.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1192457683552614", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>There's been <a href=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/10/find-number-of-google-subscribers-for.html\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2007/10/a-list-google-reader-back-slapping.html\">lot</a> <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/14/how-many-google-reader-subscribers-do-you-have/\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/14/top-blogs-on-google-reader/\">discussion</a> this weekend about the subscriber counts that have recently appeared in Reader's search results. Leaderboards have been drawn up, numbers are being compared and in some cases there's confusion as to how these numbers compare with other subscriber metrics. Additionally, we've made changes (some as recently as today) as to how counts are being calculated. This is probably going to be pretty boring unless you're a feed publisher, but we thought it would be best to explain things a bit. Here are the various numbers you may come across, and what they all mean:</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Google subscriber counts:</b> These numbers include subscribers across\nall Google services, including Reader, iGoogle, and Orkut.  You can\nsee them in Reader's feed search results (pictured below) and <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/09/subscriber-stats-and-more.html\">the Google Webmaster Tools</a>. Additionally, our crawler\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?answer=70001\">reports them to the publisher</a> each time we fetch the feed. Reader's feed search was recently showing stale and incomplete data, but as of today (October 15) the numbers should be the same everywhere.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/RxNbjmLD3ZI/AAAAAAAAAF8/shgMG27kECU/s1600/subscribers-screenshot.gif\" width=\"487\" height=\"142\" alt=\"Google Blog subscriber counts\" style=\"border:solid 1px #ccc;padding:4px\"></p>\n\n<p><b>FeedBurner numbers:</b> If  you use <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/\">FeedBurner</a> to manage and track your feed, you will see a subscriber count there that is attributed to \"Google Feedfetcher.\" This number is a sum of all the feeds that you have redirecting to your FeedBurner feed URL. So if <code>http://www.example.com/atom.xml</code> has 3 subscribers, <code>http://www.example.com/rss.xml</code> has 7 subscribers and <code>http://feeds.feedburner.com/Example</code> (where you redirect the other two feeds now) has 12 subscribers, then you will see 3 + 7 + 12 = 22 subscribers reported in the FeedBurner interface.</p>\n\n<p>What this all means if you're a feed publisher is that if you're interested in getting the most comprehensive overview of your subscribers, you should be using a service like FeedBurner or Google Webmaster Tools. On the other hand, if you're a Reader user, we hope you take advantage of the numbers that we now show next to search results, so that you can pick the most appropriate feed to subscribe to.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=4p0iEhg4\"><img src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=4p0iEhg4\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/o4allNNuKgA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1192457683552", "published": 1192462500, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1190136289, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/00440035703859104490/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Steve Goldberg's shared items"}, {"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Nick Baum", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/918926279449657401/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/99d83869ac1ea0b9", "categories": ["user/00440035703859104490/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/breaking-up-isnt-hard-to-do.html"}], "title": "Breaking up isn&#39;t hard to do", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/157932794/breaking-up-isnt-hard-to-do.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1190100942409832", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>Dear \"Labs\",</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/Ru9hRVpvZFI/AAAAAAAAAEU/gX_VbiESkVU/s1600/labs-broken-heart.jpg\" alt=\"Broken Heart Labs Beaker\" width=\"210\" height=\"255\" style=\"float:right\">We don't know how to tell you this, but it's time that we break up. It's just that we're different now. People can search. They can share what they read. They can even see trends about what they read, and how often they do it. There are all sorts of things we could do in the future to make feed reading awesome. And that means you just can't be around anymore.</p>\n\n<p>But don't be sad.

We'll think of you.</p>\n\n<p>Today is a big day for us. We learned to speak some <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-reader-goes-multilingual.html\">new languages</a>. And frankly, you don't translate well. But we both speak English, and we know that \"u\" and \"I\" are far apart in the alphabet. We're farther in real life.</p>\n\n<p>It's not you.

Now you can find that that <a href=\"http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2004/07/apricot_coffee_cake.php\">apricot recipe</a> you came across a few months ago and now have a craving for. Or perhaps you'd like to search for \"ipod\" so that you can read at once all the posts in your subscriptions that mention <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news?q=ipod+touch\">today's announcements</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Search lets you use keywords to find items in your subscriptions (if you're looking to search all blogs, give <a href=\"http://blogsearch.google.com/\">Blog Search</a> a try). If you subscribe to someone's shared items, it'll search those too. This handy feature is brought to you especially by <a href=\"http://eclectic-mayhem.com/blog/\">Ben</a> and <a href=\"http://massless.org/\">Chris</a>'s tireless engineering work and <a href=\"http://www.thepinkestblack.com/\">Jenna</a>'s relentless iteration on user interface concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Along for the ride in the search release are a few other Reader tweaks. You can now hide the side navigation by clicking on the separator to its right. Unread counts now go to 1,000, so that you can know just how far behind you are when you come back from vacation. Finally, Reader now behaves like every other web page and lets you use the forward and back buttons to move between folders and subscriptions that you've navigated to.</p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to let us know how search is working out for you, or have any other Reader feedback, you can use our shiny new <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Reader-Help/\">forums</a> to get in touch.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=8xpBl\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=8xpBl\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/152805315\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1189054180275", "published": 1189052460, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1182519137, "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Nick Baum", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/5268516293848457039/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de938648136e088a", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/06/doing-shuffle.html"}], "title": "Doing the Shuffle", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/144482184/doing-shuffle.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1182533772509496", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>Some of our users, like <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/\">Robert Scoble</a>, can go through 600 feeds in less time than it takes to say \"mark all as read\":</p>\n\n<p><iframe src=\"/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.viddler.com/player/6be21c4f/&amp;width=437&amp;height=370\" width=\"437\" height=\"370\"></iframe>\n<br>(Thanks <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/05/16/how-scoble-reads-622-rss-feeds-each-morning/\">Tim</a> for this video!)\n</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who don't have supernatural powers and would like a quick and easy way to go through your Google Reader subscriptions, we want to highlight one of our lesser-known features: the \"Next\" bookmarklet.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Next\" bookmarklet allows you to use Google Reader through just one link -- clicking on it takes your browser to the next unread item in your reading list (marking it as read in the process).

Google's systems store data \nredundantly to minimize the chance of anything becoming permanently lost.</p>\n\n<p>We were able to identify, diagnose, and fix today's outage within an\nhour, which is the kind of response time that we strive for.  We'll\ncontinue give quick status updates to problems like this in the future\nso users who have trusted us with their data can feel comfortable\ndoing so.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=G9Url\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=G9Url\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/144482185\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1181614371773", "published": 1181608560, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1181186322, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Mihai Parparita", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/1147286670504837749/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3df8374c55cf422d", "categories": ["user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/06/on-menu.html"}], "title": "On the menu", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/144482186/on-menu.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1181186354323518", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>Sometimes we come across Reader-related things that are interesting enough that we'd like to post about them on our blog, but at the same time too small to base\na whole post around.

Worse yet, sometimes they're \"feeds\" and sometimes they're \"RSS\" -- and what is this \"Atom\" thing anyway? This <a href=\"http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english\">RSS in Plain English</a> video does a good job of explaining all that, in a very unique style.</p>\n\n<p>Also on the topic of videos, <a href=\"http://www.massless.org\">Chris</a> made a short clip showing all the places he's used his offline Reader.

With <a href=\"http://www.bolinfest.com/\">Michael Bolin</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.bolinfest.com/changeblog/2007/05/03/your-page-here-an-igoogle-gadget/\">Your\nPage Here</a> gadget, you can embed all of Reader (or any other page, for that matter) as its own tab within your iGoogle page.</p>\n\n<p>For all you <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> users, Mario Romero has created a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2007/06/04/google-reader-facebook-app/\">Reader application</a> that allows you to embed your shared items into Facebook profile. It's a bit finick-y (you have to type in your 20-digit Reader ID), but it shows how open platforms (Reader's and Facebook's) can be used together without needing permission from either party.</p>\n\n<h3>Fun Desserts</h3>\n\n<p>We've <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/11/tools-to-improve-your-reader.html\">posted</a>\nbefore about add-ons that others have made for Reader, but they've generally\nbeen of a functional nature (like notifiers and browser buttons). The\n<a href=\"http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme\">Google Reader Theme</a> that <a href=\"http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/\">Jon Hicks</a> made is entirely unlike that in that it doesn't add any functionality, it just makes Reader look very different (some might say Mac-like). A fresh face for Reader can be a lot of fun, and we were happy to see just how seamless Jon managed to make it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if Reader is just too serious for you and you'd like to view your feeds through a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcats\">lolcat</a> perspective, <a href=\"http://ian.mckellar.org/\">Ian McKellar</a>'s <a href=\"http://lol.ianloic.com/\">LOL Feeds</a> may be the thing for you.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?a=ZWAHl\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/blogspot/dtKx?i=ZWAHl\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/144482186\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1181186354323", "published": 1181170260, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1181660759, "via": [{"href": "http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "title": "Olivier Tharan's shared items"}], "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Chris Wetherell", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/4566143465919545330/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ecca83e80f14c894", "categories": ["user/09038450381508459955/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/tracking-item-link-used", "user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html"}], "title": "Oh Sam I Am, can I read it on the tram?", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/144482187/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1180600826057462", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<p>Things you can't bring with you on an airplane: Bottled water.

It occurred that Reader may be a lot of fun on the Wii, especially with many <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/flickr_interestingness\">photo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/rssls\">video</a> feeds.</p>\n\n<p>Some weekend hacking confirmed my suspicions, and the rest of the team also seemed to think it'd be a neat side project.

Google Reader has a \"Share\" button and a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/help/reader/sharing.html\">public page</a> to go along with it, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224\">some people</a> have been putting that to great use. Once you start sharing, others can subscribe to your shared items and see what you see (when you want them to).</p>\n\n<p>This works great for your feed-savvy friends. But, what if you want to share something you find in Reader with someone who doesn't use a feed reader at all?</p>\n\n<p>To the rescue comes a greatly improved email feature we're releasing today. Even Marge Simpson <a href=\"http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/1816.htm\">has email</a>, so interesting feed items you come across can now reach almost anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Now, clicking the \"Email\" link at the bottom of an item gives you the ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>send email from within Reader -- no more second window for sending email.</li>\n<li>send the entire item as it appears in Reader, including formatting and images.</li>\n<li>use your Gmail address book (if you have one) to add contacts with auto-complete.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, there you have it.

On my own blog I will often <a href=\"http://persistent.info/archives/2005/02/02/facebook\">plot</a> <a href=\"http://persistent.info/archives/2004/06/04/spam\">things</a> just to get a handle on them. Even here I've posted <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/08/namespaced-extensions-in-feeds.html\">some</a> <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2005/12/xml-errors-in-feeds.html\">analyses</a> that I've done of the data that the Reader team has on hand. It's therefore no surprise that my favorite blog of 2006 is <a href=\"http://datamining.typepad.com/\">Data Mining</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, I've always wondered how I could apply this interest to Reader's feature set. It then occurred to me that there were plenty of things that could be dug up about the items that a person reads and the feeds they are subscribed to. Perhaps some feeds post very often but don't actually get read, so they may as well be removed. Conversely, other sites may not have updated in ages, so they're just taking up room in the list of subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_QriD2y6VZ-Y/RZsZS-TrGiI/AAAAAAAAAAU/hCisEniR2lk/s400/trends2.png\" alt=\"Subscriptions table\" title=\"Subscriptions table\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:7px\" height=\"136\" width=\"271\">Playing around with these ideas, I created a simple Reader \"trends\" page, inspired by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends\">Google Trends</a> as well as the <a href=\"http://google.com/searchhistory/trends\">Search History Trends</a> page. After showing it to the rest of the Reader team and a few other interested Googlers, I began to gather feedback and implemented it. Most helpful was when <a href=\"http://www.veen.com/jeff/\">Jeff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.custompixel.com/\">Doug</a> rolled up their sleeves and applied some of the same thinking that went into <a href=\"http://www.measuremap.com/\">Measure Map</a> to this new Reader page. This went beyond just making things pretty; they helped make things easier to digest and understand.</p>\n\n<p>The result is the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/?page=trends\">Reader Trends</a> page, accessed via a link from the \"Home\" page. For example, it lets me see the spike in read items two days ago (the result of my New Year's resolution of staying on top of my 322 subscriptions). There are also my subscriptions sorted by various criteria, so I can see which I'm having trouble keeping up with. Each subscription has a unsubscribe icon next to it, which I've used for those that I decided were not worth keeping around.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any New Year's resolutions about <a href=\"http://www.everythingsysadmin.com/archives/000171.html\">time management</a> or are a chart geek like me, trends should be useful and fun.

Combined with Reader's ability to track what you have and haven't read, you can safely jet off to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=321667978&amp;size=o\">Tahiti</a> for a few weeks and never miss a post.\n<a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/174/360/1600/649465/oldest-first.png\"><img style=\"margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/174/360/400/293785/oldest-first.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n<p>Ideally, though, you'd like to catch up on those posts in the order they were written.

At the same time, we know there's still lots to do, which is why we've been busy fixing bugs and tweaking things in response to user feedback. Today we did a small release, a .0.1 of sorts. Here are some of the things that changed:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pick your start page:</strong> You can now select which page you'd like to see when you first log in to Reader (\"Home\", \"All items\", or any folder or tag). Simply go to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/settings\">settings</a> and on the Preferences tab pick which one you'd like to see.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hiding the left side:</strong> If you'd like to get the list of subscriptions on the left out of the way so you can focus on what you're reading, you can just hit the <strong>u</strong> key (press it again to go back to the regular view).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Refreshing:</strong> We've added a small \"Refresh\" link at the bottom of the list of subscriptions, so you can easily refresh them to see if there are new items. Better yet, they will automatically refresh every few minutes, so you shouldn't even have to click the link. When an unread count has changed, it will flash yellow for a split-second to help you find it. This <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000558.php\">yellow fade</a> made our Web 2.0 meter that we have in our office move up a tick.<p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2440/403/1600/web20meter.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"229\" alt=\"Web 2.0 Meter\" style=\"border:solid 1px #ccc;padding:0.5em\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Space is smart again:</strong> The space key now intelligently goes from item to item and from page to page (for longer items), just like it used to in the old interface.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all this, we've also fixed a few bugs. Your feedback in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader\">the discussion group</a> has been very helpful in helping us prioritize, so please keep posting there (even if we don't reply to every single message, we are reading all of your comments).</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/144482201\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p></p>", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1160437236175", "published": 1160422200, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1159485989, "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Ben Darnell", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/115947485335189200/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03d25c86c4c0f6c7", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html"}], "title": "Something looks... different.", "alternate": [{"href": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~3/144482202/something-looks-different.html", "type": "text/html"}], "timestampUsec": "1159488519503734", "comments": [], "content": {"content": "<a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/screenshot2-706462.gif\"><img style=\"display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center\" src=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/screenshot2-704085.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a>\nAs of today, Google Reader has a new look \u2014 and even more important, a lot of new features that we think you'll like. We've listened to your feedback, done usability research, and examined all the ways that people consume content on the web, from feed readers to email clients. With a clean interface and some JavaScript wizardry, we think we've built an application that accommodates a wide range of reading styles while being fun and easy to use.\n<p>\nSo what's new? First, we've added some things you've been asking for, such as unread counts and \"mark all as read.\"  Folder-based navigation makes it easier to organize your subscriptions, and the new expanded view lets you quickly scan over several items at once.  And we've made sharing much easier - with a single click of the \"shared\" icon, you can publish an interesting item on your public sharing page for your friends to see.  So give <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\">the new Reader</a> a try. We hope you like it!\n<p>\nAnd what about the old interface? Well, things might look different, but we made sure the new interface enabled the reading style of current Reader users. For example, clicking \"All items\" and choosing \"List view\" should make the experience feel quite familiar. But since it's possible that we've overlooked your favorite feature from version 1, you still have the option (in \"Settings\") to switch back to the old interface for the time being. If you do, please <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader\">let us know why</a> so we can improve the new version to better suit your needs.\n<p>\nOne last thing: Chris made a video for the launch.

There are even more esoteric bits of data that can be attached to feeds, like the geographic location that a post is about, the number of comments it has received and that (legal) license its contents are available under. To make all of this information easily parseable by computers, it is usually available as additional items and attributes in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Namespaces\">XML namespaces</a>. For example, the <a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss\">Media RSS</a> namespace is used to add more information about videos and pictures, like dimensions, duration and a thumbnail.</p>\n\n<p>This usually isn't of direct interest to end users, it's just matter of which namespaced extensions a feed reader supports, and the more the merrier. However, since there are quite a few ones out there, developers must make trade-offs and decisions. One easy way to prioritize extension support is to see which ones are used more often.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a small <a href=\"http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html\">MapReduce</a> program to go over our <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7278544055668715642\">BigTable</a> and get the top 50 namespaces based on the number of feeds that use them. This means that we only looked at feeds that have at least one subscriber, i.e. the <a href=\"http://blog.ask.com/2005/07/what_feeds_matt.html\">\"feeds that matter.\"</a> Note that the default namespaces for syndication feed formats (e.g. <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</code> for Atom 1.0) are excluded, since I was interested only in extensions to the elements that are already expected to be in a feed.</p>\n\n<p>We thought this information might be of interest to others, the way our <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2005/12/xml-errors-in-feeds.html\">analysis of XML errors</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html\">web authoring statistics</a> have been. If I have missed anything, or if you have any feedback, a message in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader\">our discussion group</a> or a link to this blog post is the best way

Additionally, it can have read items hidden or always visible. Until this week, the default combination was to sort automatically and show read items. Unfortunately, this meant that new items did not necessarily end up at the top, which was confusing to some users. We've therefore changed the defaults to sort by date and hide read items. If you prefer a different combination, these settings can be controlled by the links at the bottom of your reading list (pictured on the right).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related subscriptions menu:</strong> When we made the <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/06/careful-where-you-step-were-moving.html\" title=\"recent improvements\">recent improvements</a> to reading by subscription or label, we neglected one use case, which was to see a list of subscriptions that have a particular label. Based on <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader/browse_thread/thread/ec3482d479d35d05?tvc=2\" title=\"feedback\">feedback</a> from our users, we've added a new menu, \"Related subscriptions,\" that shows up when selecting a label or a subscription that has labels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Starring in the mobile interface:</strong> Our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/m/\" title=\"mobile interface\">mobile interface</a> is handy for when you're on the go, but occasionally you can come across an item that you would like to re-read when you're back at your computer. Until now, the mobile interface provided no way to flag an item so you could find it later. Now all items that you read have a \"Add star\" link at the bottom of the page, so you can easily add it to your starred items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong> As usual, with each release we try to polish Reader by fixing bugs here and there. Some recent ones that we've squashed include: better Safari support on the settings page and when marking items as read, better support for non-audio enclosures and better support for <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/04/02/Relative-References\" title=\"relative URLs in entries\">relative URLs in entries</a>.\n\n<p>A lot of these changes were made in response to user feedback and bug reports. The best way to make yourself heard is to post in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader\" title=\"our discussion group\">our discussion group</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/dtKx/~4/144482204\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1153337318515", "published": 1153336860, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}, {"origin": {"title": "Official Google Reader Blog", "htmlUrl": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/", "streamId": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml"}, "updated": 1151448923, "isReadStateLocked": true, "author": "Chris Wetherell", "replies": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/feeds/115142429483038008/comments/default", "type": "application/atom+xml", "title": "Post Comments"}], "id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dce0c07286efe7c5", "categories": ["user/14548369432350969777/label/google corporate", "user/14548369432350969777/label/Inbox", "user/14548369432350969777/state/com.google/read"], "canonical": [{"href": "http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/06/careful-where-you-step-were-moving.html"}], "title": "Careful where you step!

Clicking on that link opens up a new screen that lists all of your subscriptions and labels, and allows you to make edits to more than one item at a time. We've also added a bunch of new filtering and selection controls.

First, a bit of background. Reader uses JavaScript. A lot of it. So much that it would take a while to download even on a broadband connection. What we (and other Google products) do is to compress it before sending it to the user. So this line of code:</p>\n\n<p><code>FR_Queue_currentQueue.pageDown();</code></p>\n\n<p>becomes:</p>\n\n<p><code>t.ma()</code></p>\n\n<p>Only people care about descriptive names like <code>pageDown</code>; to a computer, <code>ma</code> is just as good. It turns out that these compressed names will change from release to release, as we tweak the code (the more often a name is used, the shorter the compressed name that's chosen for it). Greasemonkey scripts that rely on these compressed names (like the aforementioned one) will therefore break.</p>\n\n<p>So far the situation sounds pretty dire. How can more stable scripts be written? The answer turns out be quite simple. Reader has UI controls for most things that you'd want to do from a script. For example, if you want to automatically move the queue down, you can think of that as being equivalent to the user clicking the \"Down\" button repeatedly. Those buttons have IDs that we promise won't change without a good reason. Through JavaScript, you can simulate user clicks. Therefore, if your Greasemonkey scripts relies on them, you'll be all set. To give an example, I've written <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/googlereaderautoread.user.js\">a modified version of the auto-read script</a> that uses this method. It has code like the following (the <code>simulateClick</code> function is included in the script):</p>\n\n<p><code>simulateClick(getNode(\"queue-down\"));</code></p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps other Greasemonkey scripts authors that are trying to tweak Reader (and other sites too).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

Since Reader accounts number in the hundreds of thousands in only our first two weeks of being out there it seems fair to say that there <em>is</em> some.  Demonstrated need drives development - so we think we can go ahead with many of our plans which have included more interfaces (the <em>lens</em> is just one of several planned approaches), better ways of recommending new things to you and performance bolstering.</p>\n\n<h4>Big kitchen?  Big table.</h4>\n\nEvery few seconds or so there's a bit more of everything on the internet.  Feeds reliably so.   Reader is using Google's BigTable in order to create a haven for what is likely to be a massive trove of items.  BigTable is a system for storing and managing very large amounts of structured data and  Jeff Dean just gave a <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/htbin-post/mvis/mvis?ID=437\">talk</a> about it at the University of Washington and Andrew Hitchcock was nice enough to make a <a href=\"http://andrewhitchcock.org/?post=214\">summary</a> for those interested in an overview.  \n\n<h4>With a little help from the internet</h4>\n\nLike many geeks, we love people tweaking, twisting, pushing a technology to be more useful in the ways that suit them best.  Here's some recent favorites: \n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://andywibbels.com/flash/google_reader.htm\">How to use Google Reader</a>, a Flash tutorial by <a href=\"http://andywibbels.com/\">Andy Wibbels</a></li><li><a href=\"http://holizz.com/2005/10/08/google-reader\">Holizz' favelets list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://godsmoon.blogspot.com/2005/10/google-reader-bookmarklet-version-20.html\">Godsmoon's bookmarklet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://chrisnolan.ca/archive/ID/658\">Chris Nolan's Reader badges, buttons, and chicklets</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you develop anything Reader-related <a href=\"mailto:labs+reader@google.com\">drop us a line</a>.  We'd be happy to post about it here.  We're excited to be making Reader - most of us slept overnight at the office during launch week.  It's been an amazing experience.</p>\n\n<p>We're curious about one thing, though, and maybe the developers of other feed reader projects can tell us about their experience when testing their products...</p>\n\n<p>How do you stop from being distracted by, well, <em>the whole internet</em>?  It's an endless divertimento - I mean, seriously, it just keeps coming...</p>", "direction": "ltr"}, "crawlTimeMsec": "1129223322595", "published": 1129895460, "annotations": [], "likingUsers": []}], "direction": "ltr", "id": "feed/http://googlereader.blogspot.com/atom.xml", "title": ""}
